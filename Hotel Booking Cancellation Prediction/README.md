In this project, I led the development of five classification machine learning models to predict whether a customer will cancer their reservation or not.
The hotel booking data was downloaded from Kaggle which is an open-source data library for data science professionals and enthusiasts to share knowledge and skills.
After a thorough data cleaning and exploratory process, the the processed data was used to train five algorithms including Random forest, Logistic regression, Support vector machine, Gradient Boost and XGBoost models.
Ater testing and evaluting the performance of each model, the Random forest model outperformed the other models with an accuracy score of 0.71, F1-score(No and Yes classes) of 0.78 and 0.57 respectively indicating an average performance.
This model will enable hotels make targeted retention strategies, reducing cancellations and enhancing customer loyalty.
